# Recurrent-neural-network-model.-Infected-by-Covid-19-Worldwide-
Recurrent neural network model for time series. The model was made with Python 3 together with the Tensorflow, Scikit-learn, and standard libraries.
The neural network has a general structure and is capable of generating predictive models of up to 5 days of convergent prediction for the number of infected worldwide.

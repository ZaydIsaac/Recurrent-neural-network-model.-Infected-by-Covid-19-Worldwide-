
The architecture of the neural network is simple and easy to understand. The database that the model uses is included. 
The database has many parameters but the one of interest is the number of people infected by Covid-19 worldwide. 
The network can generate models using any other time series database in the same format as the database found in this 
publication.

We are very grateful to the John Hopkins University School of Medicine for allowing us access to their database of the 
number of infected worldwide. If you want to update the database, please, go to the John Hopkins University repository and 
copy only the new files,DO NOT REPLACE THE ONES ALREADY IN THE DATABASE YOU DOWNLOADED HERE. Be guided by the 
reading direction in the program.

Please, check the database and its format if you want to generate your own predictive model 
in your country or region. This program is ready to run with the database that was published here. You can modify the 
program as you want. If you will use the program in any publication, please mention this repository and its author. 

Thank you.
